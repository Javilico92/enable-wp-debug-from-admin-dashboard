READ DESCRIPTION BEFORE INSTALLING!
Easily enable/disable WP_DEBUG with one single click from Admin Toolbar. What's more, this plugin is failsafe & clever - in case of errors, it automatically exits the WP_DEBUG mode, thus, you won't face any problems.

* Works with `Debug Bar` plugin. 

= NOTE =
Plugin modifies `wp-config.php`. However, on some sites, this might cause some conflict with existing wp-config, causing to interfere the page-load. So, use at your own responsibility. If unsure, use on test site.

= Available Options =
